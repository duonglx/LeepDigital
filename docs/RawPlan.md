# [New project] Leep digital inflow channels


Transform offline channels into digital inflow channels and build an AI-based self-development sales model


1. Conclusion

Shinhan Bank Vietnam will transform its existing offline touchpoints (53 branches, 600 sales staff, 6,000 merchants, and corporate relationship channels) into digitally traceable customer acquisition channels,
and build a self-evolving sales structure powered by AI, without relying on head-office driven campaigns.
Through digital business cards (QR), landing platforms, and generative AI integrated with the existing Core system, Corporate CRM, and SOL mobile app, we will establish a virtuous cycle:

Offline → Digital Conversion → CRM Accumulation → AI-Driven Follow-up Sales

This strategy is not limited to card expansion.
It is a structural transformation of how sales operate across Retail, SOHO, and Corporate banking.

2. Current Situation and Structural Limitation

2.1 Existing Assets


-53 branches
-600 RMs/CRMs
-Approximately 6,000 merchants
-SOL mobile app 
-Core banking system 
-Corporate CRM 
-Marketing channels: Branches, App, Zalo, Email, SMS

We already possess strong offline infrastructure and digital tools.

2.2 Structural Limitation

- Offline customer touchpoints are not accumulated as digital assets
- Customer acquisition paths are not traceable
- CRM functions mainly as a record-keeping system
- Sales performance is often campaign-driven and episodic
- No automated system generates next sales opportunities from accumulated data
 

As a result, significant offline interaction does not translate into scalable growth.

3. Strategic Objective

3.1 Objective

Transform offline touchpoints into digital acquisition channels, accumulate behavioral data, 

and build an AI-driven structure where sales continuously evolve without centralized instructions.

3. Strategic Objective

3.2 Core Message

-Offline is not declining — it must be digitally amplified. 
-The 6,000 merchants must evolve from payment network to customer acquisition channels. 
-Cards, deposits, loans, and corporate finance are outcomes of a unified acquisition and AI-driven growth engine.

4. New systems and Functional Roles

4.1 Digital Business Cards (QR)
Each offline sales entity receives a unique QR code:

-Retail RM 
-Branch staff 
-Merchant owner 
-Merchant employee 
-Corporate RM

All customer inflow becomes traceable and attributable.

4.2 Landing Platform (Conversion Hub)
After QR entry, customers can:

-Explore products
-Open accounts
-Apply for cards
-Request consultations
-Connect to SOL

All actions are recorded:
-Click behavior
-Product interest
-Dwell time
-Conversion
-Drop-off

This becomes the behavioral data foundation.

4.3 Generative AI (Cross-Segment Growth Engine)

AI is applied across all segments — not only corporate.

Functions include:

-Behavioral analysis 
-Conversion probability scoring 
-Churn risk detection 
-Next Best Action generation 
-RM action guidance 
-Merchant management prioritization 
-Sales script generation
AI becomes a sales multiplier, not just a recommendation tool.

5. Customer Segment Application

5.1 Retail Segment

Flow:

RM → QR → Landing → CRM → AI

-Retail customers enter via digital business card 
-Behavior is automatically transferred to CRM 
-AI analyzes product interest and predicts:
  + Card likelihood 
  + CASA potential 
  + Loan needs 
  + Cross-sell opportunities 
-AI generates actionable follow-up tasks for RMs

Retail sales move from episodic to continuously optimized.

5.2 SOHO Sement - Strategic Core: 6,000 Merchants as Acquisition Channels


 the most critical transformation lies in redefining the merchant newtwork.

5.2.1 Structural Redefinition

Today: Merchant = Payment channel

After transformation: Merchant = Customer acquisition channel

Each merchant generates daily real-world customer interaction. The payment moment becomes the beginning of financial engagement.

5.2.2 POS-Based Inflow Structure
When conditions are met:
-Repeat customers
-High transaction amounts
-Non-Shinhan card users
POS displays product suggestions.

Merchant employee QR → Landing → Application → CRM → Incentive

This creates measurable acquisition through merchant channels.

5.2.3 Sales Motivation Loop

The RM who acquired the merchant receives:

-Performance attribution from products generated within that merchant 
-Additional incentive based on accumulated activity

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

Merchant acquisition
→ Customer inflow increases
→ Product performance increases
→ RM incentives increase
→ RM motivation to acquire more merchants increases

Merchant expansion becomes self-driven, not campaign-driven.

5.2.4 AI-Based Merchant Management
As merchant numbers increase, manual management becomes inefficient.
AI will:
-Monitor merchant revenue patterns
-Detect transaction shifts
-Identify loan timing signals
-Detect churn risk
-Suggest upsell opportunities

RMs receive prioritized action lists and sales scripts.

Merchants evolve from payment processors to continuously managed financial partners.


5.3 Corporate Segment

Corporate structure follows the same digital inflow model:

Corporate RM → QR → CRM accumulation

AI integrates:

-Internal cash flow 
-Deposit/loan movement 
-Buyer/supplier network 
-External news and industry trends

Outputs:
-Opportunity alerts
-Risk signals
-Recommended engagement strategy
-Summarized insights with external links

Corporate sales become intelligence-driven rather than reactive.

6. Expected Outcomes (All Segments, Not Card-Focused)
 

This strategy generates growth across:
-Retail acquisition and retention
-SOHO ecosystem expansion
-Merchant-based inflow engine
-Corporate opportunity detection
-CASA growth
-Loan expansion
-Card growth (as one outcome among many)
-Sales productivity improvement (20%+ expected)
-Transition from campaign-driven to data-driven organization

As data accumulates, AI improves.
As AI improves, sales effectiveness increases.
The system becomes self-reinforcing.

7. Implementation Phasing

Phase 1
-Digital QR
-Landing platform
-CRM auto-transfer
-Inflow dashboard

Phase 2
-Merchant employee model
-POS integration
-Incentive structure implementation

Phase 3
-Advanced AI across retail, SOHO, corporate
-Next Best Action automation
-Predictive analytics

8. Final Assessment
The core of this strategy is not card expansion alone.
The core is:
-Transforming 6,000 merchants into acquisition channels
-Digitizing all offline touchpoints
-Accumulating inflow data
-Applying AI across all segments
-Creating a self-evolving sales organization

Cards, deposits, loans, and corporate finance are outputs of a unified digital growth engine.

This is not a marketing initiative.

It is a structural redesign of how Shinhan Bank Vietnam grows.
